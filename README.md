### At its core Swarm City is a blockchain based marketplace with a built in reputation system.
## Swarm City uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to allow people to communicate and transact value, and earn contextual reputation.

**The blockchain provides transparency, so users can safely interact with people they donâ€™t know, while keeping their private information to themselves. Smart contracts make sure interactions go as planned, and generate marketplace specific reputation for successful deals.**

Swarm City users can:

- buy and sell products and services in a decentralized way.
- easily create and manage marketplaces for others to transact in.
- build communities of like-minded individuals to benefit from economies of scale.
- get rewarded for being a good actor by earning immutable reputation.
